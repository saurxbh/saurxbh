# Hi, I'm Saurabh! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I am a Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer. I love learning new technologies and building cool things with it. I have this unquenchable thirst for knowledge, which has made me a lifelong student. This quest for knowledge, coupled with the absolute joy I find in the process of creation, has driven my pursuit of a career in Engineering and Development. 

### Projects
Here are some of the things that I have built:
- [CRUD Demo App](https://www.github.com/saurxbh/crud-demo): I built this simple web application that provides CRUD functionalities using Java Spring Boot and React, and I used MySQL for the backend.
- [Movies Review App](https://www.github.com/saurxbh/movies-review): Another web application I built using Java Spring Boot and React. I used MongoDB as backend to develop this IMDbesque application, albeit with only a couple features, viz. you can watch trailers in the player that pops up, without leaving the site, as well as you can post reviews.
- [Etch-A-Sketch](https://www.github.com/saurxbh/etch-a-sketch): Built this as part of The Odin Project, this course I am taking. Simple DOM Manipulation.
- [Calculator](https://www.github.com/saurxbh/calculator): No one tells you how pesky it is to deal with operator precedence while evaluating expressions. Well, except maybe TOP. Another thing I built as part of the course using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

Feel free to check out the rest of my repos. It's mostly a mess, but rather make a mess getting your hands dirty in code, than claiming to be a passionate programmer and not being able to reverse a linked list, innit.
